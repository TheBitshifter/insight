	Insight: An analysis framework for executable formats
       =======================================================

Insight provides a framework to analyze binary files using static
analysis, model-checking and theorem proving techniques.

Insight is released under a 2-clause BSD license (see the 'COPYING'
file for more details).

For now, Insight supports x86-32 and ARM architectures for
analysis. Because it currently depends on the GNU binutils to read
binary files and decode instructions, it is further limited to what
your installation of the binutils allows. See the 'INSTALL' file to
compile the binutils with support for all architectures.

Insight is released as a library and we provide only tests; we are
working on tools which will be released later under the same license.
