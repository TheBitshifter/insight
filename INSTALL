		  Insight Installation Instructions
		 ===================================

Basic Build and Install
========================
The insight framework needs a UNIX-like environment to build and work
properly. It relies on a small number of widely used libraries and
tools, and here is the list of dependencies if you downloaded the
tarball of a release. Package names may vary depending on your
operating system distribution.

binutils
g++
libstl (probably provided with g++)
libxml2

Insight can be easily installed thanks to the usual:
'./configure && make && make install'.

In case of error, the 'configure' script should provide some useful
error messages that will help you to get through.


MacOS X Build and Install
==========================
Under MacOS X, you will need to install UNIX packages either by hand
or by using MacPorts, Fink, or similar package systems. We tested and
use insight with MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/).

The insight framework needs the following additional packages to build
and operate:

Apple's XCode
binutils
libxml2
pkgconfig

./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include \
	    LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib/x86_64

Note that, if you are using a system older than Snow Leopard (10.6.x),
you will need to use a slightly different command line:

./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include \
	    LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib

The paths given are correct for MacPorts. Fink uses /sw as its root
directory.

Possibly unusual configure flags are available:

 --enable-werror         compile with -Werror flag (default is no)
 --enable-debug          compile with debug (default is no)
 --enable-optimize       compile with optimization (default is no)


Building in a separate directory
=================================
If you want to build the project outside of the source directory, just
create a fresh directory (eg. 'build/'), cd into it and type:
<path_to_srcdir>/configure <suitable_options>

This should run exactly as if you were in the source directory but
keeping built files apart from the source files.

We recommend this way of building as it leaves the source directory
clean.


Using more binutils file formats/architectures
===============================================
On most operating system distributions the binutils package comes only
with the minimum needed processor architectures and binary formats. In
fact, the binutils can do much more than that and can deal with a lot
of architectures and binary formats.

The Debian-based systems propose a binutils-multiarch package that
includes among others ARM support and adds several extra binary
formats. It is generally a good idea to install it and to execute the
following command as root (we assume binutils-2.22):

# cd /usr/lib/
# ln -s libbfd-2.22-multiarch.so libbfd-multiarch.so
# ln -s libopcodes-2.22-multiarch.so libopcodes-multiarch.so

If you do not have a Debian-based system, or if you want more than
what binutils-multiarch package provides, you will need to recompile
and install the binutils by yourself.

Getting the sources can be done by FTP:
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils/

Building the sources goes as usual, except that we will ask configure
 to build all the binutils supported targets this way:

./configure --enable-targets=all && make && make install

Under NetBSD, we found it necessary to pass also the '--disable-nls'
option to configure.

You will probably need to point to this installation of the binutils
when invoking 'configure' within insight. E.g.:

./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib


Developer Build and Install
============================
Developers are, of course, more than welcome in this project and
feature requests, development questions and patches will be looked at
and commented upon by the Insight team (see the README file for more
contact information).

In order to build insight from a fresh checkout of the sources, you
will need the following additional packages:

autoconf
automake
bison (/usr/bin/bison is too old under MacOS X)
flex
GNU libtool

Getting a fresh development snapshot of the source:

$ svn checkout https://insight.labri.fr/svn/trunk insight

Then, change to the directory you just checked out ('insight' here)
and you will be able to generate all the autoconf stuff with:

./autogen.sh

You can then proceed with the usual 'configure' step.


Generate the Doxygen documentation
==================================
Insight comes with a Doxygen API documentation. We chose to not build
it by default to spare time and space. Yet, building the HTML API
documentation can be done as follow (in the following we assume that
the build is in the 'build' directory):

1) Go to build/doc
2) Type: make api
3) Documentation will appear in build/doc/api/html/


Test Framework (ATF/Kyua)
=========================
We use ATF (Automated Test Framework) together with the Kyua runner in
order to test the framework. At the moment, we require a recent
version of Kyua which is not available as a package on most
systems. So, the best way to go is to install it directly from their
stable or development sources.
